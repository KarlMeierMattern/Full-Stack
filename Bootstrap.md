# Bootstrap  
Bootstrap is a front end framework used to design responsive web pages and applications.  
It takes a mobile-first approach to web development, and includes pre-built CSS styles and classes, plus some JavaScript functionality.  
Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name responsive design.  
With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.  

## Import statement  
You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:  
<code><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/></code>  

## Adding classes to HTML  
- `class="img-responsive"` will cause an image to fit perfectly to the screen.  
- `class="text-center"` will center text.  
- `class="btn btn-default btn-block btn-primary btn-info btn-danger"` for button elements.  
- `class="form-control"` all textual `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` elements with this class have a width of 100%.  
- `class="well"` creates a visual sense of depth for your columns.  

## Grid system  
Bootstrap uses a responsive 12-column grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width. Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element.
- `class="col-xs-4"` 4 specifies how many columns wide the element should be.

## Font-awesome  
Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons.
