### Data Types  

JavaScript provides eight different data types which are:  
1. undefined  
2. null  
3. boolean  
4. string  
5. symbol  
6. bigint  
7. number; and  
8. object

### Variables  

    var ourName;  
    ourName = 5;  

> `var ourName` is the ==variable delcaration==  
> `ourName = 5` is the variable assignment  
> In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons  

Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.  

It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared:  

    var myVar = 0;
