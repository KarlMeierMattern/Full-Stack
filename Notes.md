### Data Types

1. undefined  
2. null  
3. boolean  
4. string  
5. symbol  
6. bigint  
7. number; and  
8. object

### Variables  
var ourName;  
ourName = 5;  
> Assigns the number 5 to ourName  
> In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons  

Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
